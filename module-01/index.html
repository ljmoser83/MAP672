	<h1>My Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
    <p>At this point in my career I would most likely identify myself as a cartographer. I currently have a fairly well-developed GIS skillset that spans multiple desktop and web-based GIS applications. With this experience, I hope to develop my skills as a coder throughout this course and integrate coding into my mapping projects for more advanced mapping design and capabilities. With that being said, the biggest priority that I currently have set for my mapping career is to learn to utilize coding to make my mapping products more interactive and informative to the user. I hope to be able to explore the development of web-based mapping applications that can be utilized on mobile platforms as well. </p> 
    <p>Points #6a. (Maps of the digital world are a reflection of the material world) and #6b. (But this reflection is imperfect and distorted) seem to be the most problematic points of web mapping and coding identified within the Floating Sheep Manifesto for me. When producing a static or interactive web map, it is critical to consider the distortions (whether through scale, projection, statistical methodology, etc.) that may be present in your work. Distortions are often subjective and may easily mislead a user lacking prior knowledge of a topic. Mapping and coding with a strong set of ethics and under a system of full disclosure of assumptions and techniques may help to reduce these distortions. I hope to find ways to incorporate these disclosures of techniques, statistical methods, projections, and assumptions that are made in my work into the metadata documentation included with published mapping products. </p>
