## Specifications of the deliverables

### edit the README.md file

Write some Markdown! Update the *README.md* file created and modified through lesson-01 to include a sub-heading titled "My Learning Objectives" (use two ## to make a subheading) followed by 4 &ndash; 6 bullet points of specific skills and learning outcomes you home to achieve within this course.

### edit the index.html file
